![Galileo](http://galileodart.com/assets/images/logo.png)

[Galileo](https://galileodart.com) is a full-featured, full-stack, server-side framework for the Dart programming language.
It is batteries-included and provides almost all of what you need for real world API's, out of the box. As an added bonus, Galileo lets you share logic between the client and server, and has a thorough
[documentation](https://github.com/galileo-dart/galileo/wiki),
supplemented by a detailed
[Dartdoc](https://www.dartdocs.org/documentation/galileo_common/latest) and multiple
[tutorials](#tutorials).

Feel free to star :star: this repo! And while you're at, star the
[main boilerplate](https://github.com/galileo-dart/galileo)! Many thanks!!!
