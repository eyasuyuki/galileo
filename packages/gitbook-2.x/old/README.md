There are a few server-side frameworks rising within Dart at this moment, but Angel has a different goal than all the rest. Angel aims to be a server-side framework optimized for full-stack development. Angel users should be able to write both their backends and frontends **entirely** in Dart, and share as much code across each platform as possible.

## Flexible!
For this to work, Angel must be flexible, and have a low learning curve. Thus, the basic API is modeled after Express, and new functionality is added via plug-ins.

## Hot Reloading!
[Hot reloading](https://github.com/angel-dart/hot) is a great solution to slow edit-refresh cycles, and makes the Angel experience unlike that of any other framework, in _any_ other language.

## Scalability!
The final goal of Angel is **scalability**. As your application grows, Angel aims to continue working, with little or no change in server-side configuration.

## Let's go!
