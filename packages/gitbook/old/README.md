There are a few server-side frameworks rising within Dart at this moment, but Galileo has a different goal than all the rest. Galileo aims to be a server-side framework optimized for full-stack development. Galileo users should be able to write both their backends and frontends **entirely** in Dart, and share as much code across each platform as possible.

## Flexible!
For this to work, Galileo must be flexible, and have a low learning curve. Thus, the basic API is modeled after Express, and new functionality is added via plug-ins.

## Hot Reloading!
[Hot reloading](https://github.com/galileo-dart/hot) is a great solution to slow edit-refresh cycles, and makes the Galileo experience unlike that of any other framework, in _any_ other language.

## Scalability!
The final goal of Galileo is **scalability**. As your application grows, Galileo aims to continue working, with little or no change in server-side configuration.

## Let's go!
